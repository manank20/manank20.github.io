I had totally forgotten that I had written a few blogs during my GSoC project in 2023, until today, when I came across UCSC OSPO post on linkedin and followed the link and then I recollected about the blogs I wrote, so I decided to add the links over here for archiving. I had a great learning experience during the 2023 Google Summer Of Code, with UC Santa Cruz, OSPO. My mentors Philip and Aldrin very helpful and knowledgeable. For more technical details about the project, check out the links below.

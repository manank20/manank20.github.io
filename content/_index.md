## About me
I'm Manank, currently working as a Software Engineer at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/en/). I love working with code that gets down to the basics. I mostly use C, Rust and bash for my day-to-day stuff. And I'm into Linux, especially messing around with the kernel. Areas of interest 
include Operating Systems, Filesystems, Distributed Systems, Assembly, Digital Forensics, Reverse engineering etc.
Outside work and coding, I enjoy riding motorcycles. I own a Himalayan 450(Built for all roads, Built for no roadsðŸ˜‰), and hitting the road for weekend breakfast rides or trails on it is my favorite way to unwind.
When I'm not doing that or working, I like reading books, and Photography, I have DJI Action 2 and Nikon D5300, a kit lens and 70-300 zoom lens. 
I like snapping pictures of landscapes or just quick moments that catch my eye.

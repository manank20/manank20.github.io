## About me
Hi I'm Manank, from Ahmedabad, currently a final year student persuing my bachelors at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/).
I like computer systems, compilers (I often spend my time looking at assembly generated by various compilers and differences between them, like clang and gcc, sometimes clang/gcc and rust),
Assembly, Operating Systems(I also spend my time following some linux kernel mailing lists), system performance and optimization. I'm fascinated by the history of Computers in general, things like the
evolution of unix from when people from bell labs were working on multics, and the evolution of C and linux into what it is today. In my free time, I rice up my desktop setup(I use arch btw), try
to bring absolutely anything I can in the terminal, surf hackernews, lwn and reddit etc.

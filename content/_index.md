## About me
Hi I'm Manank, from Ahmedabad, currently a third year student persuing my bachelors at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, Goa](https://beta.bits-pilani.ac.in/).
I like computer systems, compilers (I often spend my time looking at assembly generated by various compilers and differences between them, like clang and gcc, sometimes clang/gcc and rust :wink:)
, Operating Systems(I also spend my time following some linux kernel mailing lists), system performance and optimization.

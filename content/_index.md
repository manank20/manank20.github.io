## About me

I'm Manank, a Software Engineer at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/en/) in Pune, originally from Ahmedabad. My interests lie at the intersection of systems programming, compiler technology, and operating systems. I enjoy working close to the hardware—primarily using C/C++, Rust —and often dive into assembly, kernel internals, and performance optimization. I actively follow Linux kernel developments and have a strong interest in the history and evolution of computing, from Unix and C to modern systems. Recently, I’ve been particularly drawn to Rust, comparing it with C in areas such as runtime efficiency, memory footprint, and developer productivity.


When I’m not exploring systems and code, I like motorcycling—I ride a Royal Enfield Himalayan 450, perfect for both roads and trails. Weekend rides are my favorite way to reset. I also enjoy photography with my Nikon D5300 and DJI Action 2, especially landscapes and spontaneous moments, and I often spend downtime reading books.
